# Clanboss Calculator Assistant

## Given the release of version 2 of the Clanboss Calculator, which includes a built-in system for sharing tunes, this add-on is currently depricated. There may be future updates that work on the new calculator, but currently none are in the works. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know by submitting an Enhancement request at https://github.com/BryanCuneo/cb-calc-assistant/issues. Thank you :)

A browser extension for [DeadwoodJedi's Clanboss Calculator](https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/clan-boss-speed-calculator) that enables the exporting and importing of JSON files to save and share your CB speedtunes for Raid: Shadow Legends.

Tested in Firefox 80.0 and Chrome 85.0.4183.83.

Not associated with DeadwoodJedi or Raid.

# What does it do?
This extension adds three buttons to the calculator. One to import a file, one to export the current data, and one to reset/clear the fields.
