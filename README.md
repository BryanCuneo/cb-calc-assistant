# This is a fork of the original project by Bryan Cuneo.
It exists only as a means to share unofficial updates to the extension until Mr. Cuneo gets around to updating the official version.

# Clanboss Calculator Assistant
A browser extension for [DeadwoodJedi's Clanboss Calculator](https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/clan-boss-speed-calculator) that enables the exporting and importing of JSON files to save and share your CB speedtunes for Raid: Shadow Legends.

# What does it do?
This extension adds three buttons to the calculator. One to import a file, one to export the current data, and one to reset/clear the fields.
